  Bots on Little Golem

Bots are allowed on the server from 1 January 2026 only for casual games when someone challenges them. The permitted bots are listed at [bots](https://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/bots/index.jsp) and you can start a game with them directly. The bots play regular tournaments among themselves so that players can get an idea of their strength. Nowadays it is no longer a problem to program bots that are strong enough to beat any human in any board game. Therefore they are not allowed to play in tournaments.
