## Rules

The playing pieces are called stones. The start player uses the black stones and the other, white. The players take turns to either place a stone on a vacant intersection (point) of the board or to pass. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally-adjacent points, in which case the stones are captured.[4] The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move (both pass). When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second).[5] Games may also be terminated by resignation.

Go has simple rules but is extremely complex.

### Hahn Pointing System

The Hahn Pointing System is a new method to determine the tournament winner using points earned as a result of each game in place of the players win/loss record. Professor Sang-Dae Hahn of Myongji University developed the system to foster aggressive, fighting games with an emphasis on reading.

The Hahn system is based upon the scoring used in [bangneki](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Bangneki). Points are awarded to the winner and the loser of the game based upon the result. A single game is worth 100 points. The 100 points are divided between the winner and the loser based upon the difference in count at the end of the game.

A difference of 0.5 to 10 in the count results in the winner receiving 60 points and the loser receiving 40 points.

A difference of 10.5 to 20 in the count results in the winner receiving 70 points and the loser receiving 30 points.

A difference of 20.5 to 30 in the count results in the winner receiving 80 points and the loser receiving 20 points.

A difference of 30.5 to 40 in the count results in the winner receiving 90 points and the loser receiving 10 points.

A difference of more than 40 points results in the winner receiving all 100 points and the loser receiving no points.

The tournament winner in a Hahn pointing system scored tournament is the player with the most points, regardless of the player's win/loss record in the tournament. Therefore, a player with 580 points and a win/loss record of 5-2 beats a player with 570 points and a perfect win/losss record of 7-0.

### Random board

Players play from a position, where there are already 100 stones on the board. 
The positions have been checked for equality by the computer.

Game go 11x11 is played on toroid. The left side of the board is linked to the right, and the top side to the bottom. Each point is adjacent to four other points.
